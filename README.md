This repository stores all data and R scripts used in "Quantifying uncertainty from aerosol and atmospheric parameters and their impact on climate sensitivity" by C. Fletcher, B. Kravitz, and B. Badawy.
Note that the direct emulation, intro, sensitivity, and validation scripts (as well as the helper functions from the common script) are adapted from Doug McNeall's "famous-git" repository, located at https://github.com/dougmcneall/famous-git.
